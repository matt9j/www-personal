      <description>The fight to end systemic racism, particularly against my Black neighbors in the United States (my home), continues beyond the summer of 2020, beyond the 2020 election, and beyond a blog post. The Internet is a vast place, but in this corner I hope to make this undeniably clear. The injustice served to Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery this spring, to the many hundreds killed, and to millions of Black folks marginalized through systemic denial of opportunity in a country they helped build, is shameful.</description>

      <description>Over the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve re-worked a lot of my own personal infrastructure, and learned a lot along the way. My ultimate goal will be to get all my infrastructure off of feed-based social media platforms and see how hard it is to recapture some of the magic of the young web, but of course that&amp;rsquo;s a long road ahead :)
I&amp;rsquo;m excited today to have finally finished one step on that journey, modernizing my old manual site onto a framework built around markdown content and a static site generator (I went with Hugo since I have some golang experience, I&amp;rsquo;m a little afraid of node_modules, and of course it&amp;rsquo;s fast).</description>
