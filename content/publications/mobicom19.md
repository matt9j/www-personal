#### abstract:

In this paper we introduce CoLTE, a solution for LTE-based community networks.
CoLTE is a lightweight, Internet-only LTE core network (EPC) designed to
facilitate the deployment and operation of small-scale, community owned and
operated LTE networks in rural areas with limited and unreliable backhaul. The
key differentiator of CoLTE, when compared to existing LTE solutions, is that in
CoLTE the EPC is designed to be located in the field and deployed alongside a
small number of cellular radios (eNodeBs), as opposed to the centralized model
seen in large-scale telecom networks. We also provide performance results and
lessons learned from a real-world CoLTE network deployed in rural Indonesia.
This network has been sustainably operating for over six months, currently
serves over 40 active users, and provides measured backhaul reductions of up to
45% when compared to cloud-core solutions.
