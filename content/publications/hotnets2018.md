#### abstract:

The radio interfaces and network architectures of WiFi and cellular
systems are converging along many dimensions. While both systems are
largely adopting the centralized architecture of traditional cellular
deployments, this design comes with fundamental disadvantages that
limit how these networks grow and develop. As a response, we present
Distributed LTE (dLTE), an architecture offering the high radio
performance of licensed and coordinated waveforms as well as the
openness to organic expansion and growth of traditional WiFi. We
challenge the assumption that good performance requires a centralized
packet processing core, and propose hybrid approaches to coordination
that prioritize system openness. We argue that dLTE is a particularly
good fit for rural areas, where the LTE waveform is more appropriate
than WiFi, yet it is uneconomical for centralized providers to deploy
traditional cellular systems.
