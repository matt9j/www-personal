#### abstract:

While only generating a minuscule percentage of global traffic, largely lost in
the noise of large-scale analyses, remote rural networks are the physical
frontier of the Internet today. Through tight integration with a local
operator’s infrastructure, we gather a unique dataset to characterize and report
a year of interaction between finances, utilization, and performance of a novel,
remote, data-only Community LTE Network in Bokondini, Indonesia. With visibility
to drill down to individual users, we find use highly unbalanced and the
network supported by only a handful of relatively heavy consumers. 45% of users
are offline more days than online, and the median user consumes only 77 MB per
day online and 36 MB per day on average, limiting consumption by frequently
“topping up” in small amounts. Outside video and social media, messaging and IP
calling provided by over-the-top services like Facebook Messenger, QQ, and
WhatsApp comprise a relatively large percentage of traffic consistently across
both heavy and light users. Our analysis shows that Internet-only Community
Cellular Networks can be profitable despite most users spending less than $1
USD/day, and offers insights into the unique properties of these networks.
