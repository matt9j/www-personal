#### abstract:

In a setting of economic and infrastructural collapse, the inability
to manufacture and maintain computing resources will be an enormous
limitation on the continued use of technology. The concept of "rot"
exists for both hardware and software, referring to a slow loss of
functionality over time. Given a desire to maintain technological
capability, we raise a variety of questions about technology use in
such a scenario. How long will current hardware last through repair,
robust construction, and good maintenance practices? What would
software development and maintenance entail without today's Internet
infrastructure? What can be done to keep our software stable and
usable for as long as possible in the face of viruses, storage
degradation, and other threats? We present rough estimates of the
expected longevity of desktop and laptop hardware for various levels
of maintenance, and argue that software and hardware degradation
together jointly limit how long devices will remain usable for
computing tasks, especially those involving any exposure to external
files or networks. We propose both physical and social strategies to
guard against both modes of degradation.
