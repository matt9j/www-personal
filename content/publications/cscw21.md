#### abstract:

Congestion control mechanisms, by which network users share constrained capacity
on Internet links, are heavily studied in computer science. Such mechanisms are
traditionally automated, assuming that users do not wish to be involved in
addressing congestion. However, in community-owned and operated networks, users
have control over daily operational choices. We explore the design of
community-based congestion policies and mechanisms, through the lens of network
capacity as a Common Pool Resource (CPR).

Through a series of workshops and interviews in a rural community in Oaxaca,
Mexico, we encounter design opportunities for new types of tools supporting
communal network management. Participants expressed desires for preserving
individual privacy while collecting longitudinal data to track the network's
impact on the community, prioritization of high-value applications, equal link
sharing between users, and human-mediated congestion management in lieu of
automated enforcement. We report qualitative insights and offer design
directions for future systems to address network resources in a manner
compatible with Ostrom's principles for CPR governance.
