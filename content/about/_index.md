## my work
I am currently a graduate student at the University of Washington ("U-dub")
affiliated with the [ICTD Lab](https://ictd.cs.washington.edu) and
[Prof. Kurtis Heimerl](https://kurti.sh).

My research focuses on Community Cellular Networking with an emphasis
on the challenges of implementing and sustaining Community Cellular
networks in the 4G and 5G era. I also have some ongoing work in
cellular network security and a general interest in mobile ad-hoc and
mesh networking.

## me personally
I am a human being. I enjoy learning about the world, meeting people
from different cultures, building tools, taking photographs, hiking,
bike riding, reading, trying new food, and traveling. My primary
language is English and I speak some Spanish. I tend to use emacs, but
know how to get around vim. I went to undergrad at [Rice
University](https://rice.edu) in Houston, Texas, USA and currently
reside in Seattle, Washington, USA.


## other stuff

A lot of my commercial work, volunteer activity, and smaller projects
are covered in my online portfolio site. Someday I may migrate
everything to one service, but for now check out

here : )
