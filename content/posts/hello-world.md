Over the last few months I've re-worked a lot of my own personal
infrastructure, and learned a lot along the way. My ultimate goal will
be to get all my infrastructure off of feed-based social media
platforms and see how hard it is to recapture some of the magic of the
young web, but of course that's a long road ahead :)

I'm excited today to have finally finished one step on that journey,
modernizing my old manual site onto a framework built around markdown
content and a static site generator (I went with Hugo since I have
some golang experience, I'm a little afraid of `node_modules`, and of
course it's *fast*). I'm using a slightly modified version of the
[hugo-future-imperfect-slim
theme](https://github.com/pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim)
(Thanks [Patrick Collins](https://github.com/pacollins) for building
and maintaining it!) My goal is to allow this site to now grow and
serve as a jumping off point for writing and other technical
projects. If I'm being honest with myself, I mostly did this for the
sake of learning how all this stuff works and trying something
new. After spending quite a few nights and evenings re-learning how
the web works circa 2020 with HTML5 and modern templating engines (the
last time I did a deep dive on front-end web technologies was in the
mid-2000s...) I'm excited to finally be at the 95% done point where I
feel like the site is ready to go "live".

If you're a web voyager reading this page, I hope it brings you a
little bit of joy and connection with myself, a random writer
somewhere across the Internet. Enjoy!
