It's my sister's favorite birthday cake, and probably mine as well! It's
especially good cold in a glass of milk...

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350F
2. Grease and flour the pan
3. Mix cake ingredients together in a large bowl
4. Beat 2 minutes after combined at high speed
5. Pour into the pan
6. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean.
  * 9x12 pan: 32-36 minutes
  * 10x15 pan: 19-24 minutes
  * Bundt pan: 36-40 minutes

While crust is baking...

7. Sift filling sugar and flour together

9. Whisk until completely combined

Once crust baking is completed...

10. Set oven to 325
11. Pour filling over the warm crust
