An Erin classic! These pancakes aren't quite like other pancakes. Something
about the extra fat from the ricotta makes them particularly soft, fluffy, and
delicious. With a good lemon the sweetness of the pancake itself perfectly
balances the tartness of the lemon for breakfast perfection.

### Instructions

#### Make mix...
1. In one bowl, mix dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt)
2. In a second bowl, add eggs and beat lightly with a whisk
3. Add the remaining non-lemon wet ingredients in with the eggs (milk, ricotta, and vanilla)
4. Beat wet ingredients until well-combined
5. Stir wet into dry, stirring until combined but no more
6. Fold in lemon juice and lemon zest, stirring until combined but no more

#### Cook Pancakes!

1. Heat up a pan or griddle and add butter
2. Pour about 1/3 of a cup of batter in, cooking about 3 minutes (or until small
   bubbles form) before flipping
3. Cook second side until golden, 1~2 minutes

#### Enjoy!

1. Serve warm and fresh
    * be careful and don't cover immediately-- will trap moisture that will
   destroy texture.
2. Consider garnishing with syrup or whipped cream!
