I love green bean casserole, a lot. Unfortunatley most "traditional" recipes
require the use of canned condensed mushroom soup, which almost always has soy!
I discovered this recipe for a version based on cheese instead, and have enjoyed
it!

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350F
2. Melt butter into a large skillet (medium heat)
3. Add flower and stir until it forms a smooth paste
4. Quickly add green beans, sour cream, salt, and sugar-- don't let the flower paste get overcooked/burned!
5. Stir over medium heat for ~8 minutes, until the frozen green beans have thawed and begun to cook
6. Remove from heat and pour the bean/flower/sourcream mixture into a big mixing bowl
7. Add 1 cup of cheddar cheese and 1 cup of french-fried onions, mix it all up, and transfer to a casserole dish
8. Top with remaining 1/2 cup of cheese and 1 cup of fried onions
9. Bake about half an hour, or until bubbly!

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 32 oz. of frozen french-cut green beans
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. white sugar
- 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
- 2 cups french-fried onions
