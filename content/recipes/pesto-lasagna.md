Some of us have unfortunate allergies that make a typical lasagna an itchy and
uncomfortable affair. I originally got this recipe from my partner's mom, who
found it online and modified it to taste. Give it a try and enjoy!

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350f
2. Grease a 9x13 baking pan
3. Heat the olive oil in a *large* skillet over medium heat. Once heated, add
   the mushrooms, as well as salt and pepper to taste. Cook __undisterbed__ for
   5 minutes until golden, then stir and continue cooking until carmelized (3-5
   more minutes).
4. Remove the mushrooms from the skillet and set them aside.
5. Add the butter, garlic, and oregano (and salt and pepper to taste) to the now
   empty skillet. Cook ~30s until the spices are fragrant.
6. Quickly whisk in the flower and cook for 1 more minute.
7. Add the milk and broth, bring to a boil, then stir for 1 minute.
8. Remove the sauce from the heat, and stir in all the fontina and 1/2 cup of
   parmesean cheese. The cheese should melt completely to make a smooth sauce.
   One prepared set it aside.
9. In a medium bowl, combine the spinach, pesto, and ricotta. Set it aside.
10. Return to the gresed baking pan. Spread 1/4 of the cheese sauce on the
    bottom of the pan. Create a layer of lasagna sheets (3-5).
11. Spread half the ricotta cheese mixture, half of the mushrooms, and another
    1/4 of the cheese sauce. Create another noodle layer.
12. Spread the remaining ricotta and mushrooms, add another 1/4 of the cheese
    sauce, and top with a final noodle layer.
13. Pour remaining cheese sauce over the top noodle layer. Top with the 1/2 cup
    of parmesean cheese.
14. Bake uncovered ~45 minutes, or until the top is bubbling and sufficiently
    browned to taste. Let cool 10 minutes before serving!
