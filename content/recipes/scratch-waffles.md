Erin *loves* waffles, but
[Bisquick](https://www.bettycrocker.com/products/bisquick/bisquick-original),
our previous goto mix, has soy sometimes now "...Vegetable Oil (palm, sunflower,
canola, and/or high oleic soybean oil)..." That made waffles a choice between
rolling the dice on allergies or settling for a mix we felt just didn't taste as
good.

Our friends K. and T. made these waffles for us at a DnD night though, and they
were phenomenal! Better than Bisquick with a nice chewy texture and lots of
flavor, our new staple. Is the yogurt magic??? Probably...

### Instructions

1. Melt the butter and set aside to cool slightly but not resolidify
2. In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients
    - flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients
    - yogurt, milk, melted butter from step 1, and eggs
4. Gently fold wet into dry, without over mixing
5. Cook in your favorite waffle iron!
