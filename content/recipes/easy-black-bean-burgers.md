My partner and I found this recipe in an old college cookbook, and then heavily
modified it to remove nightshades while still keeping a rich flavor! This is one
of our newer favorite recipes and will probably evolve over time.

### Instructions

1. Mash the beans, but not too much (use a food processor, blender, or just a fork).
2. Add the onion, corn, salt, garlic powder, cilantro, and rosemary. Combine all
   ingredients.
3. Add flour until the other ingredients all stick together sufficiently to make a patty.
4. Pan-fry the patties in oil for 2-3 minutes/side. Be careful-- the outside may
   quickly appear cooked while the inside is still squishy and raw.
