Originally born from two recipes. The first, based on a slight
modification to a filling from a major baking website. The second, for
the crust, recited from memory over a phone call and hurriedly written
down before again forgotten!

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Line a glass 9x13 pan with parchment paper
3. Mix crust wet ingredients together
4. Add flour for the crust and combine
5. Press into the baking pan
6. Bake 17 minutes

While crust is baking...

7. Sift filling sugar and flour together
8. Add filling eggs and lemon juice
9. Whisk until completely combined

Once crust baking is completed...

10. Set oven to 325
11. Pour filling over the warm crust
12. Bake 22-26 more minutes (until the center is set and no longer jiggles)
13. Cool at room temperature 2 hours, then refrigerate before serving.
14. Dust with powdered sugar if desired!
