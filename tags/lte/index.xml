      <title>Network Capacity as Common Pool Resource: Community-Based Congestion Management in a Community Network</title>

      <description>abstract: Congestion control mechanisms, by which network users share constrained capacity on Internet links, are heavily studied in computer science. Such mechanisms are traditionally automated, assuming that users do not wish to be involved in addressing congestion. However, in community-owned and operated networks, users have control over daily operational choices. We explore the design of community-based congestion policies and mechanisms, through the lens of network capacity as a Common Pool Resource (CPR).</description>

      <title>Whale Watching in Inland Indonesia: Analyzing a Small, Remote, Internet-Based Community Cellular Network</title>

      <description>abstract: While only generating a minuscule percentage of global traffic, largely lost in the noise of large-scale analyses, remote rural networks are the physical frontier of the Internet today. Through tight integration with a local operator’s infrastructure, we gather a unique dataset to characterize and report a year of interaction between finances, utilization, and performance of a novel, remote, data-only Community LTE Network in Bokondini, Indonesia. With visibility to drill down to individual users, we find use highly unbalanced and the network supported by only a handful of relatively heavy consumers.</description>

      <title>Rethinking network congestion (Especially in community networks)</title>

      <description>What is congestion in a network anyway? A network link suffers from congestion when demand for the link’s resources exceeds the amount of service it can supply within some reasonable duration of time, resulting in data being dropped on the floor or delayed. Both the “resources” and “reasonable duration of time” are highly situational and vary by application and type of network.[^1] Ultimately this becomes “ugh, why is the WiFi so slow today!</description>

      <title>Experiences: Design, Implementation, and Deployment of CoLTE, a Community LTE Solution</title>
      <link>https://matt9j.net/publications/mobicom19/</link>

      <description>abstract: In this paper we introduce CoLTE, a solution for LTE-based community networks. CoLTE is a lightweight, Internet-only LTE core network (EPC) designed to facilitate the deployment and operation of small-scale, community owned and operated LTE networks in rural areas with limited and unreliable backhaul. The key differentiator of CoLTE, when compared to existing LTE solutions, is that in CoLTE the EPC is designed to be located in the field and deployed alongside a small number of cellular radios (eNodeBs), as opposed to the centralized model seen in large-scale telecom networks.</description>

      <title>dLTE: Building a more WiFi-like Cellular Network: (Instead of the Other Way Around)</title>
      <link>https://matt9j.net/publications/hotnets2018/</link>

      <description>abstract: The radio interfaces and network architectures of WiFi and cellular systems are converging along many dimensions. While both systems are largely adopting the centralized architecture of traditional cellular deployments, this design comes with fundamental disadvantages that limit how these networks grow and develop. As a response, we present Distributed LTE (dLTE), an architecture offering the high radio performance of licensed and coordinated waveforms as well as the openness to organic expansion and growth of traditional WiFi.</description>
