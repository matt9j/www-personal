      <title>Black Lives Matter</title>

      <description>The fight to end systemic racism, particularly against my Black neighbors in the United States (my home), continues beyond the summer of 2020, beyond the 2020 election, and beyond a blog post. The Internet is a vast place, but in this corner I hope to make this undeniably clear. The injustice served to Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery this spring, to the many hundreds killed, and to millions of Black folks marginalized through systemic denial of opportunity in a country they helped build, is shameful.</description>

      <description>Originally born from two recipes. The first, based on a slight modification to a filling from a major baking website. The second, for the crust, recited from memory over a phone call and hurriedly written down before again forgotten!
Instructions  Preheat oven to 350F. Line a glass 9x13 pan with parchment paper Mix crust wet ingredients together Add flour for the crust and combine Press into the baking pan Bake 17 minutes  While crust is baking&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>True origins unknown, but refined over many generations, this recipe makes a delicious soft banana bread. For maximum enjoyment be sure to not over-cook it, avoid over-mixing once you&amp;rsquo;ve combined the dry and wet ingredients, and consider adding some dark chocolate chips or favorite chopped nuts!
0: Prework:  Preheat oven to 325 Lightly grease 9x5 loaf pan  1: In a large bowl mix:  2 cups flour 1 tsp baking soda ½ tsp baking powder ½ tsp salt  2: In a separate bowl mix:  1 ½ cup mashed overripe bananas (3-4) ¾ cup sugar ¾ cup vegetable oil 2 eggs 2 T vanilla (that is not a typo&amp;hellip; two tablespoons is correct)  3: Put it all together:  Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten.</description>

      <title>Ma&#39; Johnson&#39;s Fresh Blueberry Pie</title>
      <link>https://matt9j.net/recipes/blueberry-pie/</link>

      <description>Adapted and customized from a recipe appearing in a 1940&amp;rsquo;s cookbook, this recipe really hits the spot during summer fresh blueberry season.
You can make it as a traditional pie with a top crust, but the real magic is when you replace the top crust with the optional streusel topping detailed below.
Pie Instructions  Preheat oven to 425F. Prepare pie crust. In large bowl, combine blueberries, sugar, flour and cinnamon; toss lightly to mix.</description>

      <description>Over the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve re-worked a lot of my own personal infrastructure, and learned a lot along the way. My ultimate goal will be to get all my infrastructure off of feed-based social media platforms and see how hard it is to recapture some of the magic of the young web, but of course that&amp;rsquo;s a long road ahead :)
I&amp;rsquo;m excited today to have finally finished one step on that journey, modernizing my old manual site onto a framework built around markdown content and a static site generator (I went with Hugo since I have some golang experience, I&amp;rsquo;m a little afraid of node_modules, and of course it&amp;rsquo;s fast).</description>

      <title>Scaling community cellular networks with community cellular manager</title>
      <link>https://matt9j.net/publications/nsdi19/</link>

      <description>abstract: Hundreds of millions of people still live beyond the coverage of basic mobile connectivity, primarily in rural areas with low population density. Mobile-network operators (MNOs) traditionally struggle to justify expansion into these rural areas due to the high infrastructure costs necessary to provide service. Community cellular networks, networks built &amp;ldquo;by and for&amp;rdquo; the people they serve, represent an alternative model that, to an extent, bypasses these business case limitations and enables sustainable rural coverage.</description>

      <title>dLTE: Building a more WiFi-like Cellular Network: (Instead of the Other Way Around)</title>
      <link>https://matt9j.net/publications/hotnets2018/</link>

      <description>abstract: The radio interfaces and network architectures of WiFi and cellular systems are converging along many dimensions. While both systems are largely adopting the centralized architecture of traditional cellular deployments, this design comes with fundamental disadvantages that limit how these networks grow and develop. As a response, we present Distributed LTE (dLTE), an architecture offering the high radio performance of licensed and coordinated waveforms as well as the openness to organic expansion and growth of traditional WiFi.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing Rural Network Maintenance and Repair via Network Messaging</title>
      <link>https://matt9j.net/publications/chi2018/</link>

      <description>abstract: Repair and maintenance requirements limit the successful operation of rural infrastructure. Current best practices are centralized management, which requires travel from urban areas and is prohibitively expensive, or intensively training community members, which limits scaling. We explore an alternative model: crowdsourcing repair from the community. Leveraging a Community Cellular Network in the remote Philippines, we sent SMS to all active network subscribers (n = 63) requesting technical support. From the pool of physical respondents, we explored their ability to repair through mock failures and conducted semi-structured interviews about their experiences with repair.</description>

      <title>Unplanned Obsolescence: Hardware and Software After Collapse</title>
      <link>https://matt9j.net/publications/limits2017/</link>

      <description>abstract: In a setting of economic and infrastructural collapse, the inability to manufacture and maintain computing resources will be an enormous limitation on the continued use of technology. The concept of &amp;ldquo;rot&amp;rdquo; exists for both hardware and software, referring to a slow loss of functionality over time. Given a desire to maintain technological capability, we raise a variety of questions about technology use in such a scenario. How long will current hardware last through repair, robust construction, and good maintenance practices?</description>

      <title>Trust and Technology Repair Infrastructures in the Remote Rural Philippines: Navigating Urban-Rural Seams</title>
      <link>https://matt9j.net/publications/cscw2019/</link>

      <description>abstract: This paper analyzes the processes and challenges of technology repair in remote, low-income areas far from standard ICT repair infrastructure. Our sites of study are the fishing and farming villages of Dibut, Diotorin, and Dikapinisan in Aurora Province, Philippines, located in coastal coves against a mountain range. Residents are geographically isolated from urban areas, with the nearest peri-urban center of Baler a boat trip of several hours away, infeasible in some sea conditions.</description>
