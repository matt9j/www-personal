      <description>Over the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve re-worked a lot of my own personal infrastructure, and learned a lot along the way. My ultimate goal will be to get all my infrastructure off of feed-based social media platforms and see how hard it is to recapture some of the magic of the young web, but of course that&amp;rsquo;s a long road ahead :)
I&amp;rsquo;m excited today to have finally finished one step on that journey, modernizing my old manual site onto a framework built around markdown content and a static site generator (I went with Hugo since I have some golang experience, I&amp;rsquo;m a little afraid of node_modules, and of course it&amp;rsquo;s fast).</description>
